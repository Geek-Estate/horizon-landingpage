We haven't spent any time with user onboarding screens and tooltips, so we thought a few notes would be helpful to understand context prior to testing our beta app:

- The counts on the home screen are unique cities/countries in which you have at least one of the following: Facebook friends, friends of friends, or common group members
- When you drill into the list of cities, there will be more people on the other side of the click than the count suggests. We plan to add a "screen break" between those that exactly match the city, and then a button to "expand results" which will show the next nearest people
- Please play with the filters available by clicking the city name when looking at a full screen of faces
- Use settings to indicate which groups you are interested in receiving requests from
- None of the request & accept/reject components of the app have been built yet. For now, the only way to contact someone is to click "contact" and send them a message on Facebook
- Our business model is donations + service fee when you discover a new contact. first customer: http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/horizon-first-transaction/. If you're interested in hosting others
- iOS 7+ required

Use cases to test:

- Find a friend of a friend in Europe
- Filter your facegrid by one of the FB groups you care about, and browse its group members by location
