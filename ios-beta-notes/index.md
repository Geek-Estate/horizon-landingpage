We haven't spent any time with user onboarding screens and tooltips for our private hospitality networks app, so we thought a few notes would be helpful to understand context prior to testing our beta:

- The counts on the home screen are unique cities/countries in which you have at least one of the following: Facebook friends, friends of friends, or common group members
- When you drill into the list of cities, there will be more people on the other side of the click than the count suggests. We plan to add a "screen break" between those that exactly match the city, with a button underneath to "expand results" (to show the next nearest people)
- The "find members" group page does NOT push anything to those groups (individually or to the group newsfeed). All it does is turn on a filter inside Horizon so you can view members of those groups.
- Please play with the filters available by clicking the city name when looking at a full screen of faces
- None of the request & accept/reject components of the app have been built yet. For now, the only way to contact someone is to click "contact" and send them a message on Facebook
- Our business model is donations + service fee when you discover a new contact ([example customer](http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/horizon-first-transaction/)). If you're interested in hosting other travelers to raise money for charity (enabling others to "[travel by giving](http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/travel-by-giving/)") please send an email to drew@horizonapp.co
- iOS 7+ required

Use cases to test:

- Select the groups you care enough about to meet other members in person
- Find a friend of a friend, or someone who shares a common group, abroad
- Filter your facegrid by one of the FB groups you care about, and browse its group members by location
- Click to individual profiles to see your common friend(s) or group(s)
- Use settings to indicate which group members you are interested in spending more time in person with (by hosting at your house)
- Contact people by clicking "contact" (which will redirect you to that users Facebook profile)
