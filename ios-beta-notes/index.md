Please help by testing the following scenarios:

- Find a friend of a friend, or someone who shares a common group, abroad
- Filter your facegrid by one of the communities you care about, and browse its group members by location
- Click to individual profiles to see your common friend(s) or group(s)
- Use settings to indicate which community members you are interested in spending more time in person with (by hosting at your house), and what your accommodation arrangement is if they decide to visit.
- Contact people by clicking "contact" (which will redirect you to that users Facebook profile)

Some product context prior to testing:

- When you drill into the list of cities, there will be more people on the other side of the click than the count suggests. We plan to add a "screen break" between those that exactly match the city, with a button underneath to "expand results" (to show the next nearest people)
- The "find members" group page does NOT push anything to those groups (individually or to the group newsfeed). All it does is turn on a filter inside Horizon so you can view members of those groups.
- The counts on the home screen are unique cities/countries in which you have at least one of the following: Facebook friends, friends of friends, or common group members that are also using Horizon.
- The "Horizon Public" is a group that anyone using Horizon can opt in to. You can disable the group by clicking the hamburger, then the groups option, then de-selecting the check box.
- None of the request & accept/reject components of the app have been built yet. For now, the only way to contact someone is to click "contact" and send them a message on Facebook
- iOS 7+ required
