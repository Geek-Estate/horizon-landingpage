The Horizon community is a friendly place and we think it’s best if we lay out a few of our fundamental principles, the guidelines we think make this community a place worth frequenting to connect with your community. For starters, members should give a damn -- and by that we mean everyone in our community shares a desire to better understand the global community, and beyond that, to give back to others. 

Want more? Here are a few of the dos and don'ts: 

## Do (aka Good)

- Give a damn
- Encourage others
- Be helpful
- Stay relevant
- Be your true self
- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule">Think Golden Rule</a>
- Report inappropriate behavior & content

## Don't (aka Bad)     

- Waste people’s time
- Spam
- Put people down - debate ideas, not people
- Share misinformation

## Bottom Line   

The bottom line here: don’t suck. And aim to create less suckitude in the world. Follow those two guiding principles and we should get along just fine!
