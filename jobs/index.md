We are not here to flip a company, nor are we here to waste people's valuable time.

What type of environment are we building?

- Every employee MUST travel for 3 weeks per year. If you’re not addicted to traveling, you're looking in the wrong spot.
- Location independent lifestyle – want to work in Barcelona, Beijing, or Chiang Mai? Fine with us as long as you are a doer.
- Life is about more than money – if you're in the “money buys happiness” mindset, start looking elsewhere for a career.
- A distributed team - Automattic and BaseCamp are the best known examples. We'll be headquartered in either Seattle or New York, with team members working from [Impact HUB offices](http://www.impacthub.net/) around the globe. Current team is split between Santiago, Chile for [Start-Up Chile](http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/startup-chile-journey-gen-10/) and Louisville, Kentucky.

Currently seeking the following positions

- Community Managers ([more info](http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/travel-community-builders/))
- Community/Marketing Interns
- iOS Engineers

Are you passionate about travel, a get things-done person, love web technology, and believe anything is possible? Most important, do you [give a sh*t about what you accomplish in life](http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/do-you-give-shit/)?

If the answer to all 4 is yes, get in touch.
