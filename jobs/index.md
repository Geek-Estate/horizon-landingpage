Do you want to build the next Farmville, or do you seek to change the world by enabling amazing travel experiences for the next generation of travelers -- and raising money for amazing causes in the process? We are not here to flip a company, nor are we here to waste people's valuable time.

What type of environment are we building?

- Every employee MUST travel for 3 weeks per year. If you’re not addicted to traveling, you should probably look elsewhere for a job.
- Location independent lifestyle – want to work in Barcelona, Beijing, or Chiang Mai? Fine with us as long as you are a doer.
- Life is about more than money – If you’re passionate about travel, you’re probably already in the mindset that money doesn’t buy happiness. If you are in the “money buys happiness” mindset, start looking elsewhere for a career.
- An environment where everyone gives a sh*t about what they are working on.
- A distributed team - Automattic and BaseCamp are the best known example of this type of company. Likely to be headquartered at one of the 50+ [Impact HUB locations](http://www.impacthub.net/) around the globe. Current team is split between Santiago, Chile for [Start-Up Chile](http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/startup-chile-journey-gen-10/) and Louisville, Kentucky.

Currently seeking the following positions

- Community Managers ([more info](http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/travel-community-builders/))
- Community/Marketing Interns
- iOS Engineers

Get in Touch

Are you passionate about travel, a get things-done person, love web technology, and believe anything is possible? Most important, do you [give a sh*t about what you accomplish in life](http://blog.ohheyworld.com/the-give-a-shit-culture/)? If so, figure out how to get introduced to me via someone I know. And yes, [doing something like this](https://medium.com/better-humans/5ae6fb285d1) is a good strategy ([engineers start here](https://github.com/oh-hey-world)).
