Last night, I pitched Horizon at [Galvanize's Pitchers and Pitches event in Pioneer Square](http://www.galvanize.com/event/pitchers-and-pitches/#.VmIie9-rT6Y). It was a 3 minute pitch, along with 2 minutes for Q&A on our concept and business model. The lineup of 8 presentations was quite impressive - including [Givesafe](http://www.withgivesafe.org/), a project by [Jonathan Kumar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kumario), who told me about the monthly pitch event last month and convinced me to sign up as a presenter. For those who have presentated at public pitch events, you likely know 3 minutes is not much time to give a complete overview of your business. Conciseness is critical when alloted only 3 minutes. Fortunately [Startup Chile's](http://www.startupchile.org/) demo day was a 3 minute format as well ([you can see my presenation here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_l1olsg5lU)), so we already had a rough outline and presentation to start from. I modified the the presenation slightly, to include our traction (we passed 5,000 community members yesterday) and some revisions to the business model -- and practiced in advance.

...and won! 

To our great surprise, we were awarded the prize for the night (a month free membership to Galvanize). Thank you to the judges, Ben ([@gilbert](https://twitter.com/gilbert)) and Matt ([@shobe](https://twitter.com/shobe)), for awarding us the prize (and thanks to [Bryan for snapping the photo](https://twitter.com/rybanc/status/672619033489838080)). Thank you to all the engineers who have made Horizon a reality (Will, David, Yunfei, Sam, Eric, Lauren, Jay, Jeff, Anthony) -- without them, there is no product or business to pitch.

We look forward to pitching against the other Seattle winners for the chance at the trip to San Francisco.
