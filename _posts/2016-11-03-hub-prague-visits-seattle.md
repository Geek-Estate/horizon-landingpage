Back in July, I hosted three of the Impact Hub Prague team -- [Katerina Kropacova](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kropacova), [Roman Bojko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/romanbojko), and [Petr Vitek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pvitek) -- who attended the [Unlikely Allies](http://unlikelyallies.net/) global gathering at [Impact Hub Seattle](http://www.impacthubseattle.com/).

It was certainly a full household in the 2 bedroom, 2 bath condo I share with my roommate in Queen Anne (we were also hosting [Martin Montero](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinmontero)) -- so full, in fact, I actually slept at a friends' house.

We shared drinks (yes, shots), meals, and even a morning walk to Pioneer Square from Queen Anne. We made four new friends over the course of those few days, and they all experienced Seattle in an extremely affordable (and fun) way. The gravvy was furhter validating our [#TravelbyGiving](horizonapp.co/blog/travelbygiving-unlock-code/) concept with their donation to [Kiva](http://www.kiva.org/).

Katerina had the following to say after their stay:

> Horizon App is such a amazing piece of work! We have fallen in love with this idea of staying with someone local AND contributing to Kiva in exchange. We will definitely make sure to use it again when we travel.

Yes, community very much enriches travel opportunities.
