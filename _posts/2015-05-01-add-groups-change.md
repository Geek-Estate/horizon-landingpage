Facebook changed its rules, and shut off permissions to their groups APIs on April 30th as part of migrating all developers from FB Graph 1.0 to Graph 2.0. What this means for all those who have not yet signed into Horizon is that we can not automatically show you groups within Horizon based upon memberships of specific Facebook groups. 

Fortunately, you're not entirely out of luck. Today, we shipped [version 1.2 to the app store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/horizon-travel-stay-people/id960391979?mt=8) that includes a way for people to join groups directly from the app using group unlock codes. For those who are already in groups on Horizon, you will not have to re-add yourself to them with a new unlock code.

From the groups screen, you'll see a new "Add a Group" call to action:

<em>Note:</em> In [our web app](https://api.horizonapp.co/), you'll see a similar option on the [groups page](https://api.horizonapp.co/groups).

You'll then be prompted to enter your group unlock code:

Once you enter a valid code, your new group will appear in the list of your available groups. Voila!

How do you obtain unlock codes you may ask? Please inquire with your groupâ€™s administrator to see if they have one. If they are not already working with us, they may request to have a group created and code to distribute to their members by emailing us at [info@horizonapp.co](mailto:info@horizonapp.co).

<em>PS: You may use the unlock code "couchsurfing" to join the Couchsurfing community on Horizon.</em>
