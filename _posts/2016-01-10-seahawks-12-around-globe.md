One of the first things you'll notice when you arrive in Seattle is the presence of 12. You can't walk or drive very far without seeing a 12 flag hanging off a balcony or in a window -- or, at the top of the Space Needle.

Seattle's not the only place with passionate Seahawks fans; the 12 community spans the entire globe ([see the 12's Twitter account](https://twitter.com/12s)). We built Horizon to strengthen global communities by facilitating in person experiences. Of course, you can't meet others unless you know they are in the same geographic area. Thus, our product brings transparency to where members of the communities you care about are located.

Join the 12 community using the following unlock code to find other 12s around the globe:

Looking forward to a play-off win this morning in Minnesota. Go Hawks!
