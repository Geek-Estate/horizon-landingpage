Will and I have both largely been nomads for the better part of the last 5 years. We met while living in Chiang Mai, Thailand in 2012. Its safe to say we both have mild to severe doses of wanderlust.

Why do I mention this now? As a result of reading [Modern Nomads: Why the Smartest Among Us Wander](http://matadornetwork.com/notebook/modern-nomads-smartest-among-us-wander/), I came across an Ignite Phoenix talk from 2012 by Bob Roman on the topic of Wanderlust that I thought worthy of sharing here:

Do you have a case of wanderlust?
