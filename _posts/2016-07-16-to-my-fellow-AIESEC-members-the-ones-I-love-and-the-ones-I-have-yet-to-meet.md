As an international nonprofit, AIESEC aims to increase cross cultural exchange and awareness. The urgency of this mission is evident. One tragedy after the next, we are reminded that a  fundamental lack of understanding between cultures and people exists. As active members or alumni, we are devoted to creating a more connected and accepting world. 

We are united by a similar vision for this world -- aligned in our mindset. And this is exactly why this community of people is so important to me.
 
Now here’s what Horizon can do for us and our community.

Right now, I see so many lost connections. Horizon’s app gives us the opportunity to connect with more AIESEC members across the globe, strengthen our community, and enable authentic travelling experiences -- by bringing transparency to the locations of the AIESEC global community.

Horizon is not about building a new community for us. Our AIESEC community already exists,  yet we can’t even begin to grasp the reach and potential of our community. There are chapters in over 125 countries and we have served over 1,000,000 individuals in the past seven decades. We are spread all over the world, yet our shared mindset has led us to become a part of one remarkable community.

Horizon connects us to people in our trusted community. The app resembles our CouchSurfing group on Facebook. Though utilized by more than 18k, the group quickly gets overwhelming with a constant stream of notifications, eventually losing its original intent. Horizon aims to efficiently connect travelers to potential hosts. The app tells us who in any given location has the capacity to host, while also giving us the opportunity to host travelers in our space. It allows us to welcome people into our place or let others introduce us to the little quirks of the place they come from.

Anyone who has ever stayed with friends or hosts during their travels recognizes that the experience is inherently unique -- full of genuine connections and unforgettable stories. Staying in a hotel or an Airbnb is just not the same.

Download Horizon on your iPhone or Android and let’s connect.
