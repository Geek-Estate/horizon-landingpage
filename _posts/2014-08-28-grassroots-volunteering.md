If you believe in [our mission](http://www.horizonapp.co/mission), you will undoubtedly be a fan of [Grassroots Volunteering](http://grassrootsvolunteering.org/) (GV).

What is it?

> Grassroots Volunteering is a resource empowering travelers to connect to the causes and communities in the places they travel. 

The site, started 3 years ago, by Shannon O'Donnell consists of a dual database of organizations all over the world: Volunteer Opportunities & Social Enterprises. Since the day I met her in Chiang Mai in 2012, I've been a huge huge fan. The fact that she wrote a book about volunteer travel and created Grassroots Volunteering in her free time speaks volumes about her life values. She advised and [worked with us](http://blog.ohheyworld.com/welcome-shannon-odonnell/) on Oh Hey World over a year ago, and we're happy to have her on [our team](http://www.horizonapp.co/team) as an advisor for [our 2nd iteration](http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/horizon-missed-connections).

Go ahead...read Shannon's post to learn a bit more about both GV and her: [A Little Bitâ€¦ About Grassroots Volunteering](http://alittleadrift.com/2014/08/grassroots-volunteering/). You'll be glad you did.
