Most entrepreneurs believe there is a “<em>wrong</em>” in the world, and they are the ones that need to "<em>right</em>" it. For me, that wrong is the very real life lottery that exists in this world, which is as simple as where you're born. From my point of view, access to community is the only way to break that cycle and lesson the opportunity/income inequality that exists worldwide.

For further clarity on the longer term vision (and some of what got us to this point), there are two recent media hits worth noting.

An interview in the Huffington Post (conducted by [Ioana Budeanu](https://twitter.com/ioanablog)):

A podcast interview with Tony Loyd on the [Social Entrepreneur Podcast](http://tonyloyd.com/category/podcast/):

Hope the combination of the two helps bring clarity to the long term vision of Horizon, and why enabling community worldwide is so vital. Thanks for the continued support.
