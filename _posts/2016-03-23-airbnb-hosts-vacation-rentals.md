As a result of our latest product changes allowing hosts to provide a text description and link to an external website, we believe there is a compelling proposition for existing hosts on AirBnB (and other vacation rental & homestay platforms) to use Horizon as a complementary tool:

<ul>
	<li>Help your trusted network discover your listing, book direct, and perhaps get a discount (hosts we've spoken to give 10-25% off to those in their network).</li>
	<li>Indicate your willingness to rent for a longer period of time and allow travelers interested in that scenario to book direct once you assess trust (<a href="http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/sublet-support/">more on sublet support here</a>).</li>
	<li>Avoid dealing with inquiries from strangers.</li>
	<li>Get more inquires from people who share your interests (such as skiing, diving, social enterprise, EDM, etc). You can find numerous <a href="http://api.horizonapp.co/groups/">public groups on our web version</a>, and <a href="mailto:info@horizonapp.co">email us</a> if you want a new group created.</li>
</ul>

Feedback and suggestions are welcome. You can reach us at [support@horizonapp.co](mailto:support@horizonapp.co).
