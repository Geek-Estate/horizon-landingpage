There are several steps to [posting a sublet opportunity](http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/sublet-support/) on Horizon:

First, sign in and complete your host settings to detail what you have available (viewable [here](http://api.horizonapp.co/settings/) on web version). Please ensure you include link to Craigslist, AirBnB, Facebook, Dropbox, or wherever else there are photos of your space.

Second, join the relevant public groups from [our web version](http://api.horizonapp.co/groups/) (Horizon Public and Couchsurfing are the largest ones currently). Related note: we're extending the public groups you see on our web version to iOS version in our next update.

Third, indicate which groups you are willing to field inquires from via the settings screen if using iOS (or [groups screen on web](http://api.horizonapp.co/groups/))

Now, anyone that's either a friend, friend of friend, or member of a group you belong to will be able to find your sublet upon searching for the city you live in and send you a message to learn more.

That's it! Feel free to send us an email at [support@horizonapp.co](mailto:support@horizonapp.co) if you have any questions.

In the next update, we're addinng an accommodation type filter so those seeking a sublet can easily find the relevant profiles to look at ([see example here](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s254/sh/e8d9b93e-4917-47b6-9171-6d3aae6404f1/cd69a44d49d24ca0933f74758d4d40ef/deep/0/Screenshot%203/11/16,%206:00%20PM.png)).
