Horizon enables you to access friends, friends of friends, and members of communities to which you belong to find a place to stay on your next trip. We believe a mutual friend, strong shared interest, or membership in real life community to be a critical piece of our ability to connect you with high quality locals.

As a result, we've decided our largest group - "Horizon Public" (a group we setup in 2015 to make it easier for people to find "someone") - doesn't fit with our product strategy any longer. We deleted the group this week, and are asking current Horizon community members to please take a moment to login to our web app and [join public groups of interest from the groups page](http://api.horizonapp.co/groups). Membership in private groups still requires a secret code from your group administrator.

Let us know if you have questions by emailing us at [support@horizonapp.co](mailto:support@horizonapp.co).
