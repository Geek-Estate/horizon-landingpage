>  Our core mission is to increase access to travel opportunities worldwide by enabling shared hospitality among trusted contacts and communities; providing free or cheap accommodation and cultural experiences not otherwise available to them.

Do you believe in that [mission](http://www.horizonapp.co/mission)?

Do you believe travel leads to more simplistic and less materialistic lives? Do you believe traveling is a good thing? Do you believe we need simpler web experiences, focused on less information from trusted individuals rather than more information from strangers? Do you love people? Do you believe life is about more than money? Do you love traveling? Do you love technology?

We’re on the lookout for amazing community builders to join the Horizon team in the coming months...

What will those person community managers be doing?

- Owning user engagement and growth within the communities they belong to (such as [Sigma Phi Epsilon](http:///horizonapp.co/sigma-phi-epsilon), [Start-Up Chile](http:///horizonapp.co/startup-chile), or [Peace Corps](http:///horizonapp.co/peace-corps))
- Building strong relationships with travelers all over the globe
- Helping community members get answers to whatever travel related questions they may have
- Relaying feedback from the community into the product development cycle
- Speaking on behalf of Horizon at meetups and conferences
- Online marketing (& some search engine optimization)
- Finding ways to bring passionate community members together in person (in addition to exchanging hospitality)
- Facilitating discussions between community members online
- Building a presence on the top 5 travel communities
- Monitoring the Horizon brand
- Writing – keeping the Horizon blog full of amazing stories from the community
- Traveling abroad — a LOT. Absolutely nothing replaces meeting people face to face
- Prior community management and technology experience is a plus, but certainly not required.

I get asked all the time how to make money from abroad. This is one such chance. That said, if making money for doing nothing while traveling is your goal (which is the sense I get from many who want to work remotely), don’t bother following up. Community building for a startup is a 24/7 job (I did it for 4 years at Zillow) — you need to live and breathe the company, which of course means believing in the grand vision of unlocking travel opportunities.

It’s my firm belief that community building is the single most important component to building a lasting company, particularly a tech brand. If an entrepreneur doesn’t understand and invest in building a community, they don’t stand a chance to succeed long term. Our first community builders are certainly some of the most important hires for Horizon. You’ll get in on the ground level, have a chance to make a lasting impact and advocate to millions of people that traveling is a viable option for every single person. Our goal is to create a world where every single person has not only a passport, but a stamp in it.

Interested? Prove it.
