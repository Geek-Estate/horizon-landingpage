It's long, long overdue, but I wanted to publicly thank our first confirmed host post [Product Hunt release](https://www.producthunt.com/tech/horizon-2).

Who is he?

Stanford Rosenthal

Stanford Rosenthal hosted Pocket (who [I wrote about previously](http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/first-product-hunt-stay/)) in the San Francisco Bay area back in February. 

The long term goal of [Travel by Giving](http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/travelbygiving-unlock-code/) (currently supporting [Kiva](http://www.kiva.org/)), is to enable any host to raise money for their favorite charity or for the organizations facilitating those stays (such as via a community such as [Peace Corps](http://www.horizonapp.co/peace-corps)). Stanford is excited about the future prospect of raising money for his organization, [Neutralground.com](http://www.neutralground.com/).

Thank you for your generosity, Stanford.
