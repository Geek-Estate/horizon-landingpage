Since [releasing our iOS app in March](http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/horizon-app-store-release/), we've heard from a wide range of travelers from across the globe. There are hosts from over 100 countries, including far off places like Pakistan, Ukraine, and Morocco. In addition to some enhancements that we've already deployed to our [web app](http://api.horizonapp.co), we've been working on improvements to our iOS version. 

There are two main changes in our latest version (1.5) now on the App Store: a redesigned interface to browse and search cities and countries and in-app messaging.

We’ve completely redesigned how you browse cities and countries. It‘s now even easier to find where you can travel to in which you have a potential host to stay with all across the globe. Upon opening the app, scroll down until you find a city that catches your interest, or search for a specific city or country by clicking the seach box at the top of the screen.

<em>*PS: Have a high res photo of your home city that you'd allow us to use to showcase your city (either where you live, or a city you've visited)? Please send it via email to [info@horizonapp.co](mailto:info@horizonapp.co).</em>

We've received lots of feedback about (our lack of) in-app messaging. Previously, clicking the contact button from profile view opened an email message. There are two primary downsides to email: privacy and formality. We've addressed those with the ability to have conversations with others directly inside Horizon, and not spill out to your inbox (unless you want it to).

Note: In-app messaging only works if both people have the newest version of the iOS app. If you see "Email Jack" on a profile, it means that either "Jack" has only previously logged into the web app, or has not upgraded to the latest release (version 1.5). For those using the [web app](http://api.horizonapp.co) to find and contact others, you'll always be directed to email. We'll integrate in-app messaging into our web version as soon as Layer's technology is [available for web applications](http://blog.layer.com/announcing-early-access-layer-for-web/) (if you know anyone on their team, please tell them to hurry!).

If you run into any problems upgrading to the newest version or have other suggested improvements for us, please do [send us an email](mailto:support@horizonapp.co).
