Since [we released unlock codes a few weeks ago](http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/add-groups-change/), we've gotten numerous questions to the tune of "what groups are available?" and "how do I become a member of groups?"

Those are both great questions.

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/blog-add-group-unlock-code.PNG"></p>

There are a wide range of groups available on Horizon. Service organizations like [Peace Corps](/peace-corps/) and [Kivans](/kiva/). Colleges such as University of Washington, Tulane, and California Berkely. A community of community professionals, [CMX Hub](http://cmxhub.com/). Fraternities like Sigma Phi Epsilon. Accelerators like Start-Up Chile, YC, and TechStars. Hospitality exchange networks such as Couchsurfing, Hospitality Club, and BeWelcome. There are also interest based groups such as Women's Empowerment, Seahawks 12 (Go Hawks!), [Product Hunt](/product-hunt/), and Travel Startups International.

We'd rather groups spread organically to people based on someone sharing it with a trusted friend who belongs to the same community; it's actually somewhat on purpose that it's hard to join groups.

That said, we'll make it a bit easier by providing a few unlock codes for public groups currently available (there are more beyond this):

- [BeWelcome](https://www.bewelcome.org/): bewelcome
- [Couchsurfing](http://www.couchsurfing.com/): couchsurfing
- [Hospitality Club](http://www.hospitalityclub.org/): hc2015
- [Product Hunt](http://www.producthunt.com): #ph2015
- Seahawks 12: gohawks12
- Travel by Giving: #travelbygiving2015
- [Travel Startups Intl](https://www.facebook.com/groups/travel.startups.intl/): travelstartups2015
- [TrustRoots](https://www.trustroots.org/): trustroots
- [Warm Showers](https://www.warmshowers.org/): warmshowers2015
