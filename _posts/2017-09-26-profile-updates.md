Let's say you are interested in hosting travelers. Let's say you already have robust Linkedin and Twitter profiles. Let's say you have an incredibly long bio on your own website. 

Let's say you don't want to re-create all that information on yet another website (aka Horizon in this case). 

Instead, let's say you want to utilize your existing social profiles and websites to enable others to learn more about you.

Now you can.

Since our [last update](http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/whats-new-web-version/), we've added the ability to link your Horizon profile to Twitter, Linkedin, Couchsurfing, AirBnB, and an external web link so others can easily learn about you from social profiles & websites you maintain elsewhere.

That's not all. Let's say you want to quickly tell travelers you live in Greenwood, and not right in downtown? Let's say you are willing to host people if they donate $15 per night to your favorite charity. Let's say your favorite charity happens to be Kiva.

You can now do that on Horizon using the three fields we've added to the accommodation details portion of profiles: neighborhood (our most requested update), donation per night, and donation recipient (currently Kiva or Pencils of Promise).
