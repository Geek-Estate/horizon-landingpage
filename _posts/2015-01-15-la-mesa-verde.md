If I had to sum up our Start-Up Chile experience in 3 words:

> La Mesa Verde

You see, our apartment has literally zero furniture. There are two pinks lounge chairs, that appear so soft and cushy when you look at them. When you sit down, you are immediately greeted with a stiff wood board. We splurged and bought an air mattress a month ago prior to an out-of-towners visit.

Except the green table.

So much of our time has revolved around the famous green table. Since there is no other furniture, it forces everything in the house to revolve around.

Every Wednesday evening, La Mesa Verde is where our friends gather for food, drinks, and conversation. Horizon led fellow Start-Up Chile entrepreneurs Jochen (aka Maurice) and [Henry](http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/horizon-first-transaction/) to La Mesa Verde, where they. It's where we met our friend David, a master chef that cooks a master piece every Wednesday. In fact, I think David began the tradition. It began with a Saturday asado, turned into a party well into the night (8 am)

Community is

...and the kitchen looks like this...

Community is always messy. Drunken nights. Co-founder debates. Problem solving. Mornings spent reminiscing about the previous night while cleaning. Meals. But that's what makes it memorable. To me, La Mesa Verde is the definition of our community in Santiago.
