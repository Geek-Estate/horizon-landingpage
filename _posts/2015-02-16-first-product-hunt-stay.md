As you may know, [Horizon launched into a public beta on Product Hunt a few weeks ago](http://www.producthunt.com/posts/horizon-2).

We were pleasantly surprised that over 350 people liked what we've been working on enough to upvote Horizon. Within a few days, we heard from our first traveler who found a host entirely through our iOS app (we had previously facilitated stays in Santiago manually inside the [Start-Up Chile community](/startup-chile/)). 

Who is he? 

<p align="center"><img src="/assets/pocket.jpg"></p>

He goes by the name of Pocket. A few details to share:

> I'm a passionate startup entrepreneur from LA who moved to NYC and Iâ€™m making my way back to the East Coast. My background is scattered in marketing (Zaarly), product (Pinbooster), some development, and consulting (SparkConnect). I believe that meeting passionate people who are building things is as important as actually building them.

More info on Pocket: [About.me](http://about.me/pocket), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/p0cket), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/p0cket)

He's spent some time in New York, but headed back to the Bay Area next week to work on building a start-up. Are you in San Francisco area? Are you willing to host Pocket for a few nights in February or March? If so, please [send me an email](mailto:drew@horizonapp.co) or [find Pocket on Horizon and send him a message](http://www.horizonapp.co/pocket/).
