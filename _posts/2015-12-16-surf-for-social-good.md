I came across the [Surf for Social Good piece on Maptia](https://maptia.com/easkey/stories/surf-for-social-good) this afternoon, and watched the following video about the Surf for Social Good Summit (held in Bali) as a result:

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/135190985">Surf + Social Good Summit 2015</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/surfplussocialgood">Surfsocialgood</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

The summit wasn't the end of social good; it was the beginning. An excerpt from the article:

> We are reimagining surfing as a force for social good and the next big wave is to launch the [Fair Surf](http://www.fair.surf/) platform — an online and offline experience that facilitates connection, collaboration for impact, the same principles we built the SSG Summit on. This is  more than a summit, it’s a global process for change.

This is a fantastic example of a community coming together to bring real change to the world for those who need it - further proof that community changes lives.
