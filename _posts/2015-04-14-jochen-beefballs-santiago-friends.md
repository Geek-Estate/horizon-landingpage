Jochen from [LetsMake](http://letsmake.com) is a fellow member of Start-Up Chile generation 10 (we were 10.1, he was 10.2). He arrived from San Francisco several weeks late due to having to finish another accelerator, [Tumml](https://angel.co/tumml), and crashed with us for two strints covering a total of 7 weeks.

One of the first nights he was at our apartment working while sitting at La Mesa Verde, we realized what a small, small world we live in. About a month before Jochen arrived, I came across Nick Sellen, [who is validation](http://nicksellen.co.uk/host-me.html) for the [donation model]http://www.horizonapp.co/costs-fees) we've been testing, and traded several emails with him. Nick raised over $2,000 for [HandUp](https://handup.org/) while staying with people in San Francisco ([see HandUp's blog post here](https://handup.org/blog/couch-surfing-for-a-cause)); #travelbygiving at its finest. It turns out one of Nick's co-founders of LetsMake was none other than...Jochen.

Every member of our community in Santiago made an appearance at [La Mesa Verde](/blog/la-mesa-verde/) at least once. Jochen was a true regular. Of course, he lived with us for much of the time, so he had no choice on many of those fine Wednesday evenings. Fortunately for us, and for him, he never wore out his welcome.

Over the course of our time living (& traveling) together, we grew to love him for five (primary) things: "Selfie Time", his amazing potato salad, Beef Balls (he is one of the owners of [Berlin Beef Balls](https://www.facebook.com/bouletten)), "Maurice" the telvision star, and his just broken enough to be hilarious English (German is his first language). His humor never ceased to entertain us, and he was always interested in "selfie time" (he has since purchased a true selfie stick, so is really trouble now). From September until December, we kept hearing about his famous beef balls in Berlin. But we never experienced them for ourselves. Finally, in Uruguay over Christmas, Jochen made us all his famous Beef Balls. They were beyond amazing.

Will and I initially met Jochen because he needed a roof over his head; we now are extremely close friends. Thank you Jochen, for both your friendship and your support of Horizon (and Kiva by way of your donations) -- and, for finally showing us the beef ball magic.
