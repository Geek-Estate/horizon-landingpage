A week in Cuba with absolutely zero internet for 7 days made me re-realize the reality that screen addiction doesn't exist everywhere. Yet. All the time people in the developed world spend browsing Twitter, Facebook, Buzzfeed, People Magazine, and TMZ -- as well as countless hours indulging in Netflix, Hulu, and Showtime -- people in Cuba (& most other places in the developing world) spend actually talking to each other, strengthening relationships & helping each other. 

It’s no wonder their sense of community is so much stronger than ours. 

Based on [our why](http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/why-horizon-exists/), it's probably no surprise I don't believe whether a world experienced face to face is better than a world experienced through a screen is a point of discussion.

If the current global trend toward more and more time spent on your phone/tablet/computer/tv continues unopposed to the rest of the world, we’re headed toward a dangerously soulless, lonely world. Building community in the physical world, one interaction & one friendship at a time, is the only way to slow down or reverse that trend toward screen addiction.

PS #1: <em>[The age of loneliness is killing us](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/14/age-of-loneliness-killing-us?CMP=share_btn_tw)</em>, an article published in the Guardian in 2014, may provide additional useful context.

PS #2: I also encourage you to watch "[Are you living the life that you post?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXdVPLj_pIk)"
