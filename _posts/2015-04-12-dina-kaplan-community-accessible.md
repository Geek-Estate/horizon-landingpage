This company has always been about connecting like minded people in person. That's been [our goal since the beginning](http://blog.ohheyworld.com/the-story-behind-the-original-idea-of-oh-hey-world/). But why? We struggled with that for awhile. A [probing question from my friend Taylor](http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/probing-question-why/) finally led to Horizon. Those who have marketed a product know it often takes awhile to nail your positioning in a way that's clear to everyone. The only way to figure out great positioning language, is to practice repeatedly. Up until a few weeks ago, I told people the end goal for Horizon was "enabling community on demand". Unfortunately, not everyone understood exactly what that meant. I got a few blank stares. Questions. Puzzled looks. 

A few weeks ago, I got the tidbit I needed to clear up the end goal. The backstory...

Enter [Dina Kaplan](https://twitter.com/dinakaplan), who I met in Bali while at [Startup Abroad](http://www.startupabroad.org).

Without realizing it, she led me to my "aha" moment while trading a few simple Facebook messages. In New York a couple weeks ago, I got a notification that she was nearby while in the West Village. We didn't end up meeting up, but did trade a few messages. It had been awhile since we had spoken and I didn't know exactly what she was working on. When I asked, she replied:

> The Path. Making meditation more accessible.

Within 2 seconds, I understood exactly what her end goal is. Then, 30 seconds later, she asked the same question in return. It clicked. My response:

> Horizonapp.co. We're making community more accessible.

I've used this positioning with people ever since, and received looks of understanding rather than puzzlement. Thank you Dina for clearing things up for me -- and many other people over the coming months and years. I appreciate it more than you know. It just goes to show, sometimes the greatest tidbits come from the simplest exchanges and that startups are a highly iterative process.
