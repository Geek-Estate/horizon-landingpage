A number of amazing people stayed at our humble Santiago abode, [La Mesa Verde](http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/la-mesa-verde/). [Jochen](http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/jochen-beefballs-santiago-friends/), [Henry](http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/horizon-first-transaction/), and [Amy](http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/amy-kerman-oren-borovitch-horizon-founder/) are three. Two others were Ben Kneppers and Kevin Ahearn from [Bureo Skateboards](http://www.bureoskateboards.com/). In fact, they secured an extremely special place in the Horizon journey the minute they agreed to sublet their apartment to us. Without them, La Mesa Verde never would have been a "thing" (in our story), or the Wednesday tradition that bound our community together throughout our 6 months.

Ben and Kevin (left and center in photo below) stayed with us at our house in Santiago for about a week in early November (I haven’t met David (far right) as he never visited during my time in Chile). They were both incredibly easy going, amazing house guests and the type of guys you just can't help but to enjoy their company. We had quite a "gas bill" issue to resolve upon the end of our lease (it was Ben's name on all the paperwork), and they were amazing to deal with throughout that ordeal as well.

Though there are many great companies that have gone through Start-Up Chile -- many of which we got a behind the scenes look at during our time in Santiago -- my favorite company of the bunch?

None other than Bureo Skateboards. Their story is certainly worth telling, and I often do.

> Bureo designs and manufactures a unique line of sustainable skateboards. Bureo’s innovative boards are manufactured in Chile through the team’s initiative, ‘Net Positiva’, Chile’s first ever fishnet collection & recycling program. Net Positiva provides fisherman with environmentally sound disposal points, while Bureo receives highly recyclable and durable raw materials. By offering recycled high quality products, Bureo enables ethically conscious consumers to support recycling development and job growth for local inhabitants.
The name ‘Bureo’ comes from the language of the Mapuche, the native Chileans, and means ´the waves’. Selected in honor of the Chilean people, the name represents our mission. Just as a wave originates from a disturbance of wind along the ocean surface, Bureo is starting with a small change in an ocean of plastic. Through time and energy, the waves of Bureo will develop the force required to cause real change.

How can you not like turning recycled fishing nets into skateboards? Stories don't get much better than that.

They released a second video recently as well...

Thank you Ben and Kevin (& Bureo) for being a key early part of the Horizon story. Without you, we never would have [created so many friendships around La Mesa Verde](http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/la-mesa-verde/).
