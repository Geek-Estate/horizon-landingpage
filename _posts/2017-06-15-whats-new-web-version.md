Though we've been quiet here on the blog, we haven't been stagnant. After far too many months of neglect, our web app recently received an influx of development and design love. Prior to a few weeks ago, our web version lacked the ability to filter results by group and accommodation type, or search by city. Which, with the core goal of searching for people within specific communities by location, essentially made the web version largely useless to travelers. 

No longer!

Our new home screen now supports searching by city:

You can now filter your results by group and accommodation type:

Design wise, we lightened the whole interface and re-styled all the views. We know there are some who prefer to use our product on the web rather than via a native app. Not everyone has "megs" for that. Finally, travelers using Horizon's web version can access the same core functionality as those using our iOS and Android versions. A huge thanks goes to [Ryan Christoffersen](https://ryanchristo.com/) for all his hard work to make that possible.
