Though we've been quiet here on the blog, we've been busy behind the scenes. Our web app recently received an influx of development and design love, and now has the same great ability to filter results by group and accommodation type, or search by city.

Our new home screen now supports searching by city:

You can now filter your results by group and accommodation type:

Design wise, we lightened the whole interface and re-styled all the views. We know there are some who prefer to use our product on the web rather than via a native app. Not everyone has "megs" for that. Finally, travelers using Horizon's web version can access the same great functionality as those using our iOS and Android versions. A huge thanks goes to [Ryan Christoffersen](https://ryanchristo.com/) for all his hard work to make that possible.
