Set to launch in 2014, OpenDoor enables you to discover a trusted place to stay on your next trip, via a combination of your friends, their friends, and members of the same trusted member associations and affinity groups you belong to.

We bring together geographically dispersed groups and communities using a mobile connection app that enables community members to provide and receive hospitality from one another.

Why?

It’s no secret, every traveler wants a “friend” in every city they visit -- since trusted friends, and insider information, is the lifeblood of amazing travel experiences. Two people with shared passions and experiences meeting eye to eye in the same room and forming real relationships. This is where the magic in life happens.

Finding those right connections, is a horribly inefficient process. We see a better way.
