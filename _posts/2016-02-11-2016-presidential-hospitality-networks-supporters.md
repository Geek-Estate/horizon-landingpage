It's hard to watch or read the news without hearing about the 2016 Presidential Election ([Iowa results](https://www.washingtonpost.com/2016-election-results/iowa/), [New Hampshire](https://www.washingtonpost.com/2016-election-results/new-hampshire/)).

We know campaign volunteers are some of the most passionate people, as well as incredibly frequent travelers. Some of the campaigns - such as [Hillary's Host a Staffer](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/volunteer/supporter-housing/) and [Bernie Sander's request for housing for staff](https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/iowa-housing) - have efforts specifically trying to match volunteers/organizers with hosts willing to accommodate them for a few nights. Of course, Horizon was built for exactly that purpose. Thus, we created groups for each of the campaigns that supporters may use if you wish:

<strong>Democrats</strong>

Bernie Sanders: [https://berniesanders.com/](https://berniesanders.com/)

> bernieforpresident

Hillary Clinton: [https://www.hillaryclinton.com/](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/)

> hillary2016

<strong>Republicans</strong>

Donald Trump: [https://www.donaldjtrump.com/](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/)

> trumpforpresident

Ben Carson: [https://www.bencarson.com/](https://www.bencarson.com/)

> carsonforpresident

Jeb Bush: [https://jeb2016.com/](https://jeb2016.com/)

> bush2016

Marco Rubio: [https://marcorubio.com/](https://marcorubio.com/)

> rubio2016

Ted Cruz: [https://www.tedcruz.org/](https://www.tedcruz.org/)

> cruz2016

If anyone would like a group created for any of the other candidates, we're more than happy to do so. [Please get in touch](mailto:info@horizonapp.co) with the name of the candidate and we'll happily oblige.
