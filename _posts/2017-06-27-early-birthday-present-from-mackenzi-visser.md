Today marks my 35th birthday. I received an early birthday present a week ago in the form of an email from a University of Michigan student who found [our internship opportunity on AngelList](https://angel.co/horizon-2/jobs/119322-growth-marketing-marketing-community-intern). 

> Hi Drew,

> Yes, I actually just returned to Seattle for the summer from a two month long backpacking trip through Europe. I would say without a doubt it was one of the most influential experiences of my life--I firmly believe that travel is one of the most important experiences a person can have, and I believe that it is key to learning about cultural differences (and similarities).

> I have spent some time looking over the Horizon app and crowdfunding campaign, and I love the concept of Horizon. Of my experiences abroad, the best were by far the places in which I had good accommodations and hosts. It was the Airbnb hostess in Croatia who taught me how to cook traditional scampi and the friends who taught me basic German which made the trip meaningful, not stays in fancy hotels. Traveling this way gave me a much more in depth understanding of the culture I was visiting, as well as lasting connections and friends, and I would recommend it to anyone.

> When I talk to my friends at home, the two reasons they say most hold them from traveling back are fear of traveling alone, and money. Horizon provides a solution for both of these issues. By providing trusted connections to stay with, rather than total strangers, I believe many people would feel much more comfortable with the idea of travelingâ€”not only having somewhere safe to stay, but having a friendly face to answer questions and give local recommendations. I also love that Horizon provides affordable accommodations while giving back through charity, simultaneously supporting travel, cultural exchange, and the community.

> Traveling is something I hope to do as often as possible throughout the rest of my life, and I would love to be part of a team which helps others to do the same. I am in Seattle for the summer, but would be able to continue working remotely later in the year if possible. Please contact me with more information regarding this position; additionally, please let me know if I can provide any more information. I look forward to hearing from you.

> Best,

> Mackenzie Visser
