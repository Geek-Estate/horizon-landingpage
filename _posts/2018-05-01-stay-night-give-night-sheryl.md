We've been working on a new initiative called "<a href="http://www.horizonapp.co/stay-night-give-night/">Stay a Night, Give a Night</a>". The goal is to allocate tourism dollars otherwise spent on expensive hotels or vacation rentals to help those who need it most: the homeless. 

We're starting the campaign here in our hometown of Seattle. Travelers can stay with a local during their visit to Seattle, and as thanks for their host's generous hospitality, fund one night's shelter for a homeless person for every night they stay (did you know it costs just $14 to provide a child with one night of food, shelter, and stability?). In Seattle alone, an estimated 1,200 kids sleep outside every night. The donations will be allocated to at <a href="http://www.marysplaceseattle.org/">Mary's Place</a>, which has a long track record of empowering homeless women, children and families to reclaim their lives.

For travelers, the win is clear: cost savings compared to a vacation rental or hotel, in addition to experiencing Seattle with the help of a local.

We went live with the "Stay a Night, Give a Night" campaign a couple weeks ago, and have facilitated two stays. <a href="http://whynotadventur.es/">Sheryl Mihalik</a> was the first traveler we matched with a Seattle host (<a href="https://impacthubseattle.com/">Steve Johnson from Impact Hub</a>).

That stay led to funding for the equivalent of two nights of shelter for a child experiencing homelessness at Mary's Place (<a href="http://whynotadventur.es/blog/blog-post-new">her story can be found here]</a>).
