I came across [Endlessly Changing Horizon](http://www.endlesslychanginghorizon.com/) (cool name, right?), read Miranda's about page, and gravitated to the quote at the bottom by Jon Krakauer from Into the Wild:

> make a radical change in your lifestyle and begin to boldly do things which you may previously never have thought of doing, or been too hesitant to attempt. So many people live within unhappy circumstances and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security, conformity, and conservation, all of which may appear to give one peace of mind, but in reality nothing is more damaging to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future. The very basic core of a man's living spirit is his passion for adventure. The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun.

What else is there to say, except "I agree"?

What is on your <em>horizon</em>? Or, perhaps the real question is "<em>WHO</em> is on your horizon"?
