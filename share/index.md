We'd love your help sharing Horizon with people and communities you believe can benefit from the simplest way to find trusted people by location:

<strong>Example Tweet 1:</strong>

Discover trusted people to stay w/ via trusted friends & #community w/ @gethorizonapp: http://www.horizonapp.co #travelbygiving

<strong>Example Tweet 2:</strong>

@gethorizonapp = couchsurfing/airbnb with friends, friends of friends, and communities http://www.horizonapp.co #travelbygiving

<strong>Example Facebook post 1:</strong>

Horizon uses your FB graph (friends + groups) to help you discover people in your trusted network to stay with on your next trip. It's available on the app store: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/horizon-travel-stay-people/id960391979?mt=8

If you don't have an iOS device and interested/willing to host people who belong to the FB communities you trust - you can sign in to the web version at: http://api.horizonapp.co

<strong>Example Facebook post 2 (for inside a FB group that has been unlocked on Horizon):</strong>

Would anyone in this group be interested in couchsurfing with other group members while traveling (or just meeting up for drinks/coffee)?

I recently found Horizon which enables hospitality exchange inside any existing community, and this is one of the first Facebook communities they've turned on.
