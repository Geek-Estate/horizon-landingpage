We'd love your help sharing Horizon with people and communities you believe Horizon would resonate well with:

<strong>Example Facebook post 1 (for inside a FB group that has been unlocked on Horizon):</strong>

Would anyone in this group be interested in couchsurfing with other group members while traveling (or just meeting up for drinks/coffee)?

I recently found Horizon which enables hospitality exchange inside any existing community, and this is one of the first Facebook communities they've turned on.

App Store: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/horizon-travel-stay-people/id960391979?mt=8">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/horizon-travel-stay-people/id960391979?mt=8</a>

If you don't have an iOS device: <a href="http://api.horizonapp.co">http://api.horizonapp.co</a> (currently accounts for host side only)

<em>**Note if you would like us to unlock another group, please send an email with a Facebook group ID # and name to support@horizonapp.co.</em>

<strong>Example Facebook post 2:</strong>

Horizon uses your FB graph (friends + groups) to help you discover people in your trusted network to stay with on your next trip. It's available on the app store: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/horizon-travel-stay-people/id960391979?mt=8">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/horizon-travel-stay-people/id960391979?mt=8</a>

If you don't have an iOS device and interested/willing to host people who belong to the FB communities you trust - you can sign in to the web version at: <a href="http://api.horizonapp.co">http://api.horizonapp.co</a>
