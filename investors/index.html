                        <p>Horizon helps travelers find a trusted contact willing to accommodate them on their next trip. Trusted contacts include friends, friends of friends, and members of trusted professional associations, service organizations, and alumni groups to which you belong. We unlock hidden inventory of places to stay (spare couches & rooms, but also vacation rentals long term), only available to trusted networks by giving hosts control over which people and groups they are willing to field requests from. Members of parent communities can discover each other across geographies based on membership in local communities (WA Beta SigEps to national SigEps) by mapping local FB groups to others with the same parent organization. After a traveler receives accommodation, they'll be prompted to say thanks by donating to the host's favorite charity (or the organization that facilitated the connection). They can donate however much they wish, and Horizon keeps a flat fee of $3.99 from each transaction.

                        <h3>Revenue</h3>

                        <p>We've proven revenue in small numbers. We've collected $613 in total revenue, $577 of which will be donated to Kiva.org. We've given people the context of "donate whatever you want" -- and they've donated $6 per day.</p>

                        <p>This all happened in the context of “pre-beta” over 2 months. We expect to see these numbers grow with our private beta for Startup Chile.</p>

                        <h3>Go to Market Strategy</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Manually find people looking for places to stay within communities we are in (Start-Up Chile first), and telling those people about our app via comment marketing (we've found our current paying customers this way).</li>
                            <li>Win over alumni administrators one by one. They are already trusted & are incentivized to create more in person experiences & relationships among their membership base.</li>
                            <li>Target community-specific conferences where there is urgency and high demand for places to stay.</li>
                            <li>College ambassadors to spread the word: We have our first one committed already from Penn State.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Milestones</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Acceptance into Start-Up Chile - done</li>
                            <li>iOS MVP / private beta - done</li>
                            <li>Launch into private beta for <a href="http://www.horizonapp.co/startup-chile/">Start-Up Chile</a> - done (<a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2014/10/prweb12261758.htm">Press Release</a>).</li>
                            <li>Prove revenue viability in small numbers - done (<a href="http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/horizon-first-transaction/">1st paid customer story</a>)</li>
                            <li>Public release - iOS app in the app store + mobile web offering. Our launch strategy is to launch privately into select communities (Start-Up Chile, SigEps, Kiva Fellows, ImpactHUB). Thus, we need to ensure everyone within our target groups can engage with our service, not just those with iOS devices. We have another 4 weeks of full time iOS development & 4 weeks to finish the mobile web offering, then bug fixing and polish before being ready to launch the app to a broad public market.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Long Term Vision</h3>
                        <p>The dream is access to trusted contacts anywhere in the world, which requires organizing communities by location. Once a geo-located trust graph exists, using it to find a place to stay is just the tip of the iceberg of possibilities. <a href="http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/what-horizon-dream/">Longer version</a>.</p>

                        <p>Eric, Will, and I have known each other since 2012. Eric's prior business partner, John Rowles, introduced Eric and I during my search for an architect for my first travel product concept. We worked together for 3 months as a trial building the MVP of Oh Hey World, and then put an equity agreement in place. I met Will in Thailand while both living in Chiang Mai doing freelance work early 2012. We became friends over coffee shop work sessions and numerous nights out drinking (including a few Couchsurfing meetups), and began working together late in the fall of that same year.</p>

                        <h3>Company History</h3>
                        <p>The goal has always been to connect people in meaningful ways in person. Our first attempt was the location sharing platform, <a href="http://www.ohheyworld.com">Oh Hey World</a>. It's essentially Foursquare at the city level.</p>
                        <p>We learned a lot building that 1st product, much of which is outlined in this <a href="http://pando.com/2013/10/12/a-tech-startup-recap-12-months-in/">12 month recap on PandoDaily</a>. The high level summary is that an easier way to share your arrival in a new city is not a pain point for anyone outside of the long term traveler segment. Further, delivering on the value prop of finding nearby friends & like minded people requires massive scale of users — without a strong enough hook to get it to scale.<p>
                        <p>This private, trusted hospitality exchange networks iteration is focused on solving the same long term problem, but focused on a massive pain point for the 200 million millenials who travel every year -- finding a free or cheap place to stay on their next trip.<p>
