                        <p>Horizon help travelers find a trusted contact who is willing to accommodate them on their next trip. Trusted contacts include friends, friends of friends, and members of trusted professional associations, service organizations, and alumni groups to which you belong. We unlock hidden inventory of places to stay (spare rooms, but also vacation rentals long term), only available to trusted networks by giving hosts control over which people and groups they are willing to field requests from. We enable discovery of members of parent networks across geographies based on membership in local communities (WA Beta SigEps to national SigEps) by mapping geographic based FB groups to others to their parent organization. After a traveler receives accommodation, you'll be prompted to say thanks by donating to the host's favorite charity (or the organization that facilitated the connection). You can donate however much you wish, and Horizon keeps a flat fee of $3.99 from each transaction.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Revenue</h3>

                        <p>We've proved revenue in small numbers. We've done $324 in revenue, $304 of which will be donated to Kiva.org. We've given people the context of "donate whatever you want, over $3.99" -- and they've donated $7.6 per day.</p>

                        <h3>Go to Market Strategy</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Manually find people looking for places to stay within communities we are in (Start-Up Chile first), and telling those people about our app via comment marketing (we've found our current paying customers this way).</li>
                            <li>Win over community administrators one by one. They are already trusted & are incentivized to create more in person experiences & relationships among their membership.</li>
                        </ul>
