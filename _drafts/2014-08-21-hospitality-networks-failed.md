Did you know that 27% of the nearly 3 billion trips (TripAdvisor [survey](http://www.tripadvisor.com/PressCenter-i5985-c1-Press_Releases.html), 2013) every single year involve staying with friends or family? Historically, people have always stayed with known trusted contacts. Of course, most people don't know people all over the world. Which is precisely where hospitality networks come in. They give people access to a much larger group of people than on their own. 

There have been [many hospitality networks](http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/hospitality-networks-history/) over the past 75 years. Most have come and gone or remained extremely niche. 

Why?

The challenges are numerous:

Required geographic diversity -- a travel offering only truly works if an individual can us it on virtually every trip they take, which covers a vast array of locations they visit. Those who have built travel startups know this all too well. If a travelers can find someone to stay with during their trip to Charlotte next week, but not for their trip to Rome in 3 months and Lima 6 months later -- then they are likely to stop using the service entirely.

Incentives -- a hospitality network implies that their is no monetary exchange occuring. 

Monetization -- 

Technology -- this is impacted by monetization.

Those are all massive challenges by themselves, that make it extremely hard. Once a network hits scale, they run into the following problems:

Too much noise
Lack of trust
Lack of commonality

are not a new concept by any stretch of the imagination. The most well known is certainly [Couchsurfing](http://www.courchsurfing.org), which has been around since 2003 and now has over 9 million members. While the largest hospitality network on the planet, it's certainly not the only one.
