If I had to sum up our Start-Up Chile experience in 3 words:

> La Mesa Verde

Our apartment was passed from (Bureo Skateboards)[http://geekestateblog.com/power-story-telling-bureo-skateboards/] (a start-up I'm a huge fan of) to us in the middle of July.

You see, our apartment has literally zero awesome furniture. There are two pinks lounge chairs, that appear so soft and cushy when you look at them - yet when you sit down, are immediately greeted with a stiff wood board to the tailbone. We have two wood benches. Oh yeah, we have a few decent chairs. 4 to be exact, and then 3 when the legs caved on one of them. We splurged and bought an air mattress a month ago prior to an out-of-towners visit.

Except the green table ("La Mesa Verde" in Spanish). It is officially awesome.

Since there is no other furniture, it forces everything and everyone in the house to revolve around it. It's where people work, eat, watch movies, and drink. In persone experiences is the starting point to community.

Start-Up Chile brought Rory and Michael from [Fleck](http://www.getfleck.co) (and their Chilean iOS engineer Mauricio), Jorge from [adiktivo](http://www.adiktivo.com/), James at [Local Food Lab](https://www.localfoodlab.com/), and so many more. Horizon led [Henry](http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/horizon-first-transaction/), Jochen (aka Maurice) from [LetsMake](http://www.letsmake.com), Nina, Steph and Andres, and Kevin to La Mesa Verde. Egon ([Rankmi](http://rankmi.com/)) joined us as a roommate in September. It also led Oren Borovitch, our newest addition, to us via an introduction from a previous guest at our house Amy Kerman.

It all began with a Saturday asado, turned into a party well into the morning (8 am). Then we realized it was a great place to have gatherings. It's now a Wednesday evening tradition, in which La Mesa Verde is where our friends gather for food, drinks, laughs, music and conversation. 

Every Wednesday, the community looks something like this:

And every Thursday morning, la mesa verde looks roughly like this...

...and the kitchen often fares no better...

Our community is messy. Drunken nights. Co-founder debates. Midnight problem solving. Mornings spent reminiscing about the previous night while cleaning. Group meals with terrible take-out food. All that... is what makes it memorable. 

To me, La Mesa Verde is the definition of our Santiago community.

PS: For anyone in Generation 12 arriving in a couple weeks, our apartment is available for rent starting February 3rd. We'd love to hand it to another Start-Up Chile team to continue the tradition. [Get in touch if you're interested]().
