If I had to sum up our Start-Up Chile experience in 3 words:

> La Mesa Verde

You see, our apartment has literally zero awesome furniture. There are two pinks lounge chairs, that appear so soft and cushy when you look at them - yet when you sit down, are immediately greeted with a stiff wood board to the tailbone. We have two wood benches. Oh yeah, we have a few decent chairs. 4 to be exact, and then 3 when the legs caved on one of them. We splurged and bought an air mattress a month ago prior to an out-of-towners visit.

Except the green table.

It was passed from Bureo Skateboards ([a start-up I'm a huge fan of](http://geekestateblog.com/power-story-telling-bureo-skateboards/)) to us in the middle of July.

So much of our time has revolved around the famous green table. Since there is no other furniture, it forces everything and everyone in the house to revolve around it. It began with a Saturday asado, turned into a party well into the morning (8 am).

Start-Up Chile brought Rory and Michael from Fleck, Jorge, . Horizon led Jochen (aka Maurice) and [Henry](http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/horizon-first-transaction/) to La Mesa Verde. It also led Oren, our newest addition, to us.  A night out brought our friend David, a master chef that cooks a master piece every Wednesday evening.

Every Wednesday evening, La Mesa Verde is where our friends gather for food, drinks, and conversation. 

Every Wednesday, the community looks something like this:

And every Thursday morning, la mesa verde looks roughly like this...

...and the kitchen often fares no better...

Community is messy. Drunken nights. Co-founder debates. Problem solving. Mornings spent reminiscing about the previous night while cleaning. Group meals. But that's what makes it memorable. To me, La Mesa Verde is the definition of our Santiago community.

PS: For anyone in Generation 12 arriving in a couple weeks, our apartment is available for rent starting February 3rd. We'd love to hand it to another Start-Up Chile team to continue the tradition. [Get in touch if you're interested]().
