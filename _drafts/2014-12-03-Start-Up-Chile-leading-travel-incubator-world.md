AStart-Up Chile has the chance to be known as the best accelerator in the world for travel startups.

Why?

Travel community

Past Successes

The hardest part of a startup is distribution.

You cannot ask for a more international community of entrepreneurs. 

Yes, I am biased on this. Since we are a travel company

The Path Forward

How: have the startup chile community support an open source project that can help every single travel startup.

The concept: gravatar for the travel industry - returning your location

Startup Chile would be listed as a supporter along with the other companies that contribute heavily to the codebase

If this thing gains support, you'd end up with a community of developers here in Chile who are very familiar with this technology and can help travel startups integrate/build on top of it. This would be a low cost way to do something innovative with the community here.
