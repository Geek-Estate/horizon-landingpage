Community building is the lifeblood of any successful web company. If you don’t have a community, you have nothing defensible long term.

Part of a strong community is a gorgeous product that works. But community doesn’t just happen by itself even if you’ve nailed the product component. How exactly do you facilitate strong community dynamics?

Community building is NOT talking to each and every community member. Great community building is facilitating interactions, conversations, relationships, and, ultimately, friendships among community members.

That's [community building 101](http://www.geekwire.com/2013/community-building-101/).

At the end of the day, it’s well and dandy to bring community members together online, but without a doubt it’s exponentially more powerful to bring them together in person. In person conversations trump online conversations by 1,000.

Which is precisely why hospitality exchanges result in such strong community. Everyone needs a place to sleep at night while they travel. Aside from sleeping with someone, the most intimate relationships are learned. Why? You learn someone's quirks. You get a peak into their personal interests.
