Individuals do all sorts of things to raise money for charity. They walk across the United States. Dump buckets of ice water on their heads. Run marathons. Have coffee. Provide advice. 

Why not provide hospitality?

I dove into [the historical incentives for providing hospitality](http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/incentives-hosting-hospitality-networks/). It's not socially acceptable to take money from your friends when they stay at your house. But the concept of a house gift does absolutely exist. Bring some beers, a bottle of wine, or for some, donate charity. 


Why do hosts accommodate travelers at all? What's in it for them?

A few primary reasons:

- Help others afford to explore the world
- Have amazing social experiences
- Cultural exchange - travel the world while sitting in your own home
- Build new professional connections
- Learning new skills or languages
- Pay it forward, with some expectation the favor will be recipricated in the future
