title: Couchsurfing, and My Hack to AirBnB

I first attempted to use Couchsurfing back in 2010, after a few friends I met in Greece mentioned they had been using it to travel around Europe. Single females, or couples, yeah -- but as a single male, it wasn't exactly easy to find a host. I got a few of my traveler friends to "friend" me & leave reviews, and sent numerous requests to potential hosts in Madrid and Barcelona where I planned to stay for a few weeks before venturing to Kenya and Ghana. None resulted in a host. Whatever the reason -- I eventually gave up, and booked a hostel and forgot all about Couchsurfing.

Though of course I had heard about it given I had been networking in traveler circles, my first AirBnB experience didn't come until 2012 on my next extended trip abroad, in Barcelona. I stayed with [3 hosts over the course of 3 weeks](http://www.drewmeyersinsights.com/2012/08/09/a-few-airbnb-thoughts-after-my-first-three-bookings/). My first host was a Catalan lady who spoke no English, the 2nd was a designer, and the 3rd was an amazing family (Phil and Fiona Morris [OurBnB.com](http://www.ourbnb.com)). There are [numerous reasons staying with a family is amazing](http://www.drewmeyersinsights.com/2012/08/16/why-i-recommend-staying-with-families-from-airbnb/); the Morris' are just one of those families you can't help but to love.

I vew AirBnB as a paid version of Couchsurfing. The value prop, to me, is the time savings of not going back and forth with 5, 10, or even 15 potential hosts trying to find someone to take me in. With AirBnB, I just pay the fee and bypass that entire process.

AirBnB isn't built for helping me find an amazing host. It's built for helping me find a unique place to stay...which isn't my ultimate goal. I could care less about the specific details of the room I'm staying in. I'll sleep on a couch, blow up mattress (airbed), or even a foam mat on the floor -- if it means spending time with a friend or meeting an awesome connection.

So, I hack AirBnB everytime I use it...

My primary search criteria is an interesting host profile. Price is a consideration -- I'm not going to book a place to stay with a cool host if their room is $300 a night -- but within a range, I'm absolutely seeking a host with whom I share something in common. I browse host profile after host profile, and try to remember which ones seemed the most interesting. Then I narrow it down to a few. I always prefer hosts with whom I have a shared friend, given they are then more likely to give me a discount, or go a little out of their way to ensure I have an amazing time in their beloved city.

Horizon is built for those who place more importance on the connection and friendship, than on the accommodation specifics.
