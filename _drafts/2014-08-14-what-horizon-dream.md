The high level goal for Horizon long term is, and always has been, to connect people with shared passions, beliefs, experiences, & interests in person.

But....<strong>WHY?</strong>

[As you may know](http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/do-you-give-shit/), I read Dave McClure's "<a href="https://medium.com/@davemcclure/engineering-minimum-viable-inspiration-5e4a776aecdb">Engineering Minimum Viable Inspiration</a>" post the other day, which he ended with:

> Why are we here? Where are we going? What does it all mean?

We are here because a more connected travel experience is a better travel experience. Amazing travel experiences start and end with people. You either find the right person(s) resulting in amazing social interactions, or those individuals send you down the right path with tips, advice, or even an introduction to one of their friends. Have you ever done something by yourself, and had the greatest time of your life? No. You remember the people you shared those experiences with. There is no disputing that.

We are here because people who explore the world's vast array of cultures and realize they are a pivileged minority live a more fulfilling life than those who don't. If you can read [this post start to finish](http://www.drewmeyersinsights.com/2007/09/20/if-this-doesnt-hit-you-like-a-rock-i-dont-know-what-will/), and grasp that you lead a privileged life, then you might as well stop reading and continue perusing some of the hundreds of thousands of cat and dog photos.

We're here because the earlier the broadening of horizons begins in one's life, the better.

We're here because the best way to travel -- staying with a local -- also happens to be the cheapest way to travel.

We're here because the cost of a flight cannot be avoided. But the expense of a hotel can be.

We're here because life's magical moments don't occur staring at your screen.

We are here because true community matters. Every single one of life's magical moments come from community. For many, community is family. For others, it's a mix of family, friends, and like-minded connections.

We are here because finding those communities which share your passions, beliefs, and experiences by location is [incredibly inefficient at best](http://www.mykro.org/an-online-community-of-microfinance-advocates-all-over-the-globe/2012/07/). Impossible at worst.

The goddamn dream is trusted contacts by location, which implies organizing the world's communities by location. Once a geo-located trust graph is created, finding a place to stay is just one of the things you'll use it for.

Do you buy into the dream?
