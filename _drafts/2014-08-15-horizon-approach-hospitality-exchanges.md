What's so powerful about a hospitality network?

Facilitates the most intimate connections possible. You form a much deeper bond with someone if you share their home, than if you spend 10 minutes talking at a meetup.

Hopsitality exchanges occur in all sorts of niches, all the way from interest based ones such as WarmShowers (40k bicyclists) to membership based ones such as AIESEC (16k) that exist inside closed Facebook groups. Niche hospitality exchanges resulting from the Couchsurfing movement range from broad interest based networks such as WarmShowers (40k bicyclists) that exist as standalone websites/apps to membership based networks such as AIESEC (16k) that exist inside closed Facebook groups.



Our goal, is to provide the technology for any existing community to enable a hospitality exchange among their members. Some of these communities, such as Couchsurfing and BeWelcome, are communities specifically setup as hospitality networks. Others, are simply communities, and hospitality happens to be exchanged between its members from time to time.

Horizon offers a seamless way to find trusted connections based on location. Of course, "trusted" means something different to everyone. We're enabling you to define what trusted means to you.
