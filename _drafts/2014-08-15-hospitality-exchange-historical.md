title: The Horizon Approach to Hospitality Networks: Private, Trusted, and Niche

There have been many attempts at hospitality networks, most of which have ended up losing steam for a variety of reasons.

So, what's our approach? Why do we think our approach will work, while <a href="http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/hospitality-networks-failed/">previous attempts failed</a>?

A few reasons...

<strong>Mobile</strong>. The world has changed since the last real attempt at a hospitality exchange network (Tripping in 2009). Everything has gone mobile. None of the existing hospitality exchange networks have a consumer friendly mobile offering, aside from Couchsurfing (and even that is bloated). There has not been a hospitality network platform built specifically for the mobile world we live in today.

<strong>Single user utility</strong>. In prior hospitality networks, there was zero single user utility if it had no members in the specific city someone was searching for. Everyone has a mini hospitality network -- their friends and family, and friends of friends. Geolocating existing friends, and friends of friends unlocks some value to everyone in a travel scenario (either researching or in destination).

<strong>Built upon existing communities</strong>. Trusted reputations, brands, and communities take years and years to build. The world doesn't actually need more trust networks and reputation systems to increase overall trust; the ones already in place need to be better utilized. Of course, "trusted" means something different to everyone. We're enabling you to define what trusted means to you, by selecting the people and communities you trust. Some of these communities, such as <a href="http://www.horizonapp.co/couchsurfing/">Couchsurfing</a> and <a href="http://www.horizonapp.co/bewelcome">BeWelcome</a>, were specifically setup as hospitality exchange networks. Others, are simply communities where and hospitality exchange happens to be exchanged between its members from time to time (such as [Sigma Phi Epsilon](http://www.horizonapp.co/sigma-phi-epsilon)).

<strong>Consumer comfortability to strangers</strong>. A bigger percentage of people are now comfortable with Facebook, and have more friends than they did 4 or 5 years ago. Couchsurfing has proved there is a segment that is willing to accommodate total strangers. AirBnB has proved that population increases when you add financial incentives into the picture. We believe the population willing to provide accommodation can be increased by giving them control over who they trust, and 

<strong>Monetary Transactions</strong>. We are adding a financial transaction to bookings. We are not a charity. This is a business, aiming to shift some of the massive amounts of money that goes into hospitality to amazing causes. One of the major challenges hospitality networks have faced is technology. They've all relied on volunteers building their own web technology - with no money changing hands, no resources exist to invest in a consumer friendly mobile or webapp consumers will actually use.

Hospitality exchanges occur in all sorts of communities already, all the way from interest based ones such as WarmShowers (bicyclists) to membership based ones such as AIESEC and Peace Corps. Several of the interest based ones, such as WarmShowers exist as standalone websites/apps built and maintained by volunteers to membership based networks such as AIESEC (16k) that exist inside closed Facebook groups. 

Our goal, is to provide the technology for any existing community to enable a hospitality exchange among its members.
