Hospitality networks have been around a long, long time. The most well known is certainly Couchsurfing.org, which has been around since 2004 and now has over 7 million members. While the largest hospitality network on the planet, it's certainly not the only one. 

Hopsitality exchanges occur in all sorts of niches, all the way from interest based ones such as WarmShowers (40k bicyclists) to membership based ones such as AIESEC (16k) that exist inside closed Facebook groups. Niche hospitality exchanges resulting from the Couchsurfing movement range from broad interest based networks such as WarmShowers (40k bicyclists) that exist as standalone websites/apps to membership based networks such as AIESEC (16k) that exist inside closed Facebook groups.

Horizon offers a seamless way to find trusted connections based on location. Of course, "trusted" means something different to everyone.
