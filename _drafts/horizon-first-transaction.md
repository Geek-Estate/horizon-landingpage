Last week, Horizon secured our first paying customer. 

Will and I have a 3 bedroom apartment, with a maids quarter, for the duration of our Start-up Chile experience (now until January). We have an extra room/bed. Henry Lanham is a fellow entrepreneur in Startup Chile Gen 10, and needed a place to stay until he found long term accommodation. A few weeks ago, he contacted us via the private Start-Up Chile Facebok group / bulletin board, and we offered accommodation until he secured his long term arrangement. He ended up staying roughly 10 nights prior to moving into a 4 bedroom place with a few friends.

I told him to pay nothing (we're not trying to monetize a maids quarters), and instead donate whatever the stay was worth to him to [Kiva](http://www.kiva.org). Henry donated $129.97 -- and became Horizon's first paying customer in the process.

Who benefitted from this arrangement?

A place to stay that costs less than a hostel, AirBnB, or hotel, and new friendships with two fellow SUP entrepreneurs.

We ended up with a new friendship, and received a wealth of translation help. Henry speaks Spanish while Will and I only speak a tiny bit ("un poco"). Thus, he translated for me to secure a pre-paid phone from the Movistar store at Costanera the other day as well as coordinated with our doorman to schedule a maid to clean the place (it badly needed it). To cap it off, he even stocked the fridge with beers.

Start-up Chile benefits because Henry, Will, and I have a deeper friendship due to sharing an apartment for 10 days. We're all more likely to help each other with our businesses, share contacts, and keep in touch than if we had just met over a drink or coffee. That is how community is built.

The total donation was $129.97, of which Kiva headquarters received $29.97 toward their operations. 4 entreprenerus -- Florida Group in Bolivia, G.s Villa Nueva #2 Group in Honduras, Wayan in Indonesia, and Nisma Caretar Group in Yemen -- around the globe received $25 additional dollars toward growing their business.

Cheap accommodation, money to grow 4 businesses, supporting a great cause (Kiva), new friendships, and critical translation help -- a win-win, all the way around.
