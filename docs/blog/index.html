							Most entrepreneurs believe there is a “<em>wrong</em>” in the world, and they are the ones that need to “<em>right</em>” it. For me, that wrong is the very real life lottery that exists in this world, which is as simple as where you’re born. From my point of view, access to community is the only way to break that cycle and lesson the opportunity/income inequality that exists worldwide.

							Last night, I pitched Horizon at <a href="http://www.galvanize.com/event/pitchers-and-pitches/#.VmIie9-rT6Y">Galvanize’s Pitchers and Pitches event in Pioneer Square</a>. It was a 3 minute pitch, along with 2 minutes for Q&amp;A on our concept and business model. The lineup of 8 presentations was quite impressive - including <a href="http://www.withgivesafe.org/">Givesafe</a>, a project by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kumario">Jonathan Kumar</a>, who told me about the monthly pitch event last month and convinced me to sign up as a presenter. For those who have presentated at public pitch events, you likely know 3 minutes is not much time to give a complete overview of your business. Conciseness is critical when alloted only 3 minutes. Fortunately <a href="http://www.startupchile.org/">Startup Chile’s</a> demo day was a 3 minute format as well (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_l1olsg5lU">you can see my presenation here</a>), so we already had a rough outline and presentation to start from. I modified the the presenation slightly, to include our traction (we passed 5,000 community members yesterday) and some revisions to the business model – and practiced in advance.

							A number of amazing people stayed at our humble Santiago abode, <a href="http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/la-mesa-verde/">La Mesa Verde</a>. <a href="http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/jochen-beefballs-santiago-friends/">Jochen</a>, <a href="http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/horizon-first-transaction/">Henry</a>, and <a href="http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/amy-kerman-oren-borovitch-horizon-founder/">Amy</a> are three. Two others were Ben Kneppers and Kevin Ahearn from <a href="http://www.bureoskateboards.com/">Bureo Skateboards</a>. In fact, they secured an extremely special place in the Horizon journey the minute they agreed to sublet their apartment to us. Without them, La Mesa Verde never would have been a “thing” (in our story), or the Wednesday tradition that bound our community together throughout our 6 months.

Those who have marketed a product know it often takes awhile to nail your positioning in a way that’s clear to everyone. The only way to figure out great positioning, is to practice repeatedly. Up until a few weeks ago, I told people the end goal for Horizon was “enabling community on demand”. Unfortunately, not everyone understood exactly what that meant. I got a few blank stares. Questions. Puzzled looks.

A delicate marketplace balancing act spanning thousands and thousands of cities all across the globe is required to accommodate the majority of guests within a given hospitality network.

							Hospitality networks are not a new concept by any stretch of the imagination. The most well known is certainly <a href="http://www.courchsurfing.org">Couchsurfing</a>, which has been around since 2003 and now has over 9 million members.

							In 2005, MyBlogLog was the first real “community” platform that I can remember existing. Of course, blog communities existed prior to MyBlogLog, primarily in blog comments. But if you didn’t leave comments, no one knew about your existence (everyone knows most people don’t contribute content). MBL brought transparency to the faces of those reading specific blogs.
