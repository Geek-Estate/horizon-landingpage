If you really think about it, everyone on the planet (that travels) couchsurfs. They just happen to stay with known, trusted contacts rather than with strangers. The vast majority of the world has no interest to stay with strangers. Yet, everyone is fine with staying with a "friend".

We enable you to host travelers who are in your close trusted circles.

Enable rich social experiences
