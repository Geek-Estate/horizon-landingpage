If you have ever taken in a out of town friend or family member, you have engaged in a hospitality exchange. We provide a efficient way to enable your trusted friends and family to request accommodation with you while they are in town, but not be required to field requests from those outside your trusted network. 

Why host you ask?

<ul>
	<li>Enjoy rich social experiences</li>
	<li>Network with like minded individuals</li>
	<li>Help your friends afford to explore the world</li>
	<li>Unlock the magic of your city to out of towners</li>
	<li>Raise money for your favorite charity</li>
</ul>

If you really think about it, everyone on the planet (that travels) couchsurfs. Most just happen to stay with known, trusted contacts rather than strangers. The vast majority of the world has no interest in staying with strangers. Yet, everyone is fine with staying with a "friend".
