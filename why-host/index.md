If you have ever taken in a out of town friend or family member, you have engaged in a hospitality exchange. We provide a efficient way to enable your trusted friends and family to request accommodation with you while they are in town, but not be required to field requests from those outside your trusted network. 

Why host you ask?

Enable rich social experiences
Network with like minded individuals
Help your friends explore the world
Help others experience the magic of your city
Raise money for your favorite charity

If you really think about it, everyone on the planet (that travels) couchsurfs. They just happen to stay with known, trusted contacts rather than with strangers. The vast majority of the world has no interest in staying with strangers. Yet, everyone is fine with staying with a "friend".
