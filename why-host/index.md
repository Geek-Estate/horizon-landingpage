Horizon allows members of your trusted communities (academic, professional, social, religious) to see that you are open to hosting them on their next visit to your beloved city, and you a way to efficiently screen those requests.

Why host you ask?

<ul>
	<li>Have rich social experiences</li>
	<li>Network with like minded individuals</li>
	<li>Help your friends afford to explore the world</li>
	<li>Unlock the magic of your city to out of towners</li>
	<li>Raise money for your favorite charity</li>
</ul>

Trusted Communities

Your trusted communities consist of some percentage of those you know personally and members of other communities in which trust exists, even though you have not met someone personally. Usually, those communities are built upon a shared friend, passion, belief, or experience and are somewhat exclusive in nature.

We give you the control to indicate which communities you belong to are trusted.
