It’s no secret, every traveler wants a friend in every city they visit. Trusted friends, and insider information, is the lifeblood of amazing travel experiences. Two people with shared passions and experiences meeting eye-to-eye in the same room and forming real relationships is where life's magical moments stem from.

Finding those amazing connections is a horribly inefficient process. [We see a better way](/blog/what-horizon-dream/).

We faciliate finding places to stay and live among friends, friends of friends, and the communities to which you belong. We enable you to host your trusted network which includes friends and family, friends of theirs, and members of the associations and affinity groups you belong to (such as [Peace Corps](/peace-corps/) & [StartingBloc](/startingbloc/)). After their stay (if you accept), they'll have the option to say thank you by [making a donation](www.horizonapp.co/blog/travelbygiving-unlock-code/).

## Featured Campaign

With [Stay a Night, Give a Night](http://www.horizonapp.co/stay-night-give-night/), a vetted traveler stays with a vetted host and experiences all of Seattle’s magical charm through the eyes of a Seattleite. As thanks for their hosts generous hospitality, for every night the traveler stays, they donate the equivalent of one night’s shelter at [Mary’s Place](http://www.marysplaceseattle.org/), an leading Seattle organization with a long track record helping children and families reclaim their lives.

For those living in Seattle, [join the movement as a host](https://horizonapp.us14.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c102ca1457eed61da8158cebd&id=729307e82a) to transform the way travelers experience Seattle by adding purpose to their allocation of tourism dollars.

## Mission

Our mission is to increase access to travel opportunities by enabling shared hospitality among trusted contacts and communities; providing free or cheap accommodation and cultural experiences not otherwise available. Enabling more people to venture outside the friendly confines of the their own country and experience an array of foreign cultures, will grow the community of those who realize we live privileged lives the majority of the world can only dream of. Those who experience the world are exponentially more likely to work on projects that improve society and raise the standard of living for those in poverty, rather than simply maximizing income.

In short, we’re the travel community cares about making the world a better place — and [means it](http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/why-horizon-exists/).
