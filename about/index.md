It’s no secret, every traveler wants a “friend” in every city they visit -- since trusted friends, and insider information, is the lifeblood of amazing travel experiences. Two people with shared passions and experiences meeting eye to eye in the same room and forming real relationships. This is where life's magical moments stem from, for no magic ever happens while sitting on your computer or staring at your phone.

Finding those amazing connections, is a horribly inefficient process. We see a better way.

We facilitate hospitality exchanges among trusted communities.  We enable you to host your trusted network, which includes friends and family, friends of theirs, and members of the same trusted member associations and affinity groups you belong to.

Based in Seattle, WA.
