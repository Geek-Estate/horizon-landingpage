It’s no secret, every traveler wants a “friend” in every city they visit. Trusted friends, and insider information, is the lifeblood of amazing travel experiences. Two people with shared passions and experiences meeting eye-to-eye in the same room and forming real relationships, this is where life's magical moments stem from.

Finding those amazing connections is a horribly inefficient process. We see a better way.

We facilitate hospitality exchanges among communities.  We enable you to host your trusted network which includes friends and family, friends of theirs, and members of the associations and affinity groups you belong to.

What's with the name?

At an extremely high level, Horizon signifies the Broadening of Horizons (our <a href="/mission">Mission</a>). A horizon is also where two things meet. In our case, it signifies where two people come together.

Who is on your "Horizon"?
