Broaden Your Horizon

Our mission is to increase access to travel opportunities worldwide by enabling shared hospitality among trusted contacts and communities; providing free or cheap accommodation and cultural experiences not otherwise available to them. Enabling more people to venture outside the friendly confines of the their own country and experience an array of foreign cultures, will grow the community of those who realize we live privileged lives that the majority of the world only dream of. Those that experience the world, are exponentially more likely to work on projects that improve society and raise the standard of living for those in poverty, rather than just maximizing their income in life.

We will inspire people to explore the world by fostering an environment where you can make meaningful connections with others with shared passions. We believe travel is the best investment you can make in yourself in a shared global community, and we are committed to enabling engaged communities to come together all across the world.

A world where everyone has a passport stamp is a better world. We are creating a world in which that's not only possible, but a reality.

In short, we’re the travel community that gives a damn about making the world a better place — and means it.
