**Q: What is Horizon?**

**A:** Horizon helps travelers find a place to stay in places with people they already trust.

**Q: What is a community?**

**A:** A community is a trusted network of people, and source of potential hosts to stay with while traveling. Common communities include facebook friends, friends of friends, or groups which users are affiliated with such as a fraternity or university alumni association. 

**Q: What type of communities is Horizon for?**

**A:** Any community in which members desire to connect in person. Examples include service organizations, religious organizations, professional trade associations, and alumni associations. The ideal community has a large geographic diversity of members.

**Q: Which communities show up?**

**A:** Communities are currently tied to Facebook groups. Beyond the "Horizon Public" group which anyone can join, the only communities that show up inside Horizon as filters are ones we've spefically white listed as visible.

**Q: I want Horizon for my Facebook community. How do I enable that?**

**A:** Share the app with other members, and get 20 people from the Facebook group to sign up and indicate their interest in having Horizon's hospitality exchange offering available to them.

**Q: What type of community is not ideal?**

**A:** A purely local community in which the vast majority of the members reside in the same geographic area.

**Q: Horizon is NOT...**

**A:** Couchsurfing or AirBnB. 

Couchsurfing is a single hospitality exchange network ([the largest, but not the only](http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/hospitality-networks-history/)), while Horizon enables hospitality exchanges to take place among members of any existing trusted community. [Longer version](http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/couchsurfing-differences/).

AirBnB is a peer to peer accommodation marketplace allowing individuals to monetize their couches, rooms, or homes by renting to anyone with an AirBnB profile and credit card, while Horizon enables you to host only people from your trusted networks in your home, with the ability for those travelers to say thanks by donating to your charity of choice.

**Q: How are the counts of cities and countries on my home screen calculated?**

**A:** The counts on your home screen are unique countries & cities where you have either a facebook friend, friend of a friend, or a common group member that has logged into Horizon.

**Q: How do I expand my possible places to stay?**

**A:** Extend an invite to request stay at your home to those you already trust. There is certainly no requirement to reciprocate, but extending an invitation to your own home to others is the best way to get them to open their home to you, and increase the coverage of potential places to stay in unique cities and countries all across the globe.

**Q: Why do only some of my Facebook friends show up?**

**A:** Two potential reasons. First, we only display friends we can associate with a specific locations - some people do not fill out their "lives in" field on Facebook, or have it restricted so other sites cannot access it. Second, Facebook's Graph API 2.0 only returns your friends that are also using the Horizon app.

**Q: Why are accommodation details not available on all profiles?**

**A:** Visibility of accommodation details is controlled per community from your settings. Please realize different people have different living situations. Some have an extra bedroom, or couch - while others live in a tiny studio. Some have a significant other who isn't a huge fan of house guests, or may have kids. Regardless of whether they have the request stay button enabled, you can still contact trusted connections for travel advice, coffee, or a meal.

**Q: How do I edit my profile?**

**A:** The profile photo, name, and bio are all pulled via the Facebook API, with no edit capability. Your accommodation details is the only piece of information currently editable (via settings). We plan on making more of the profile customizable, but haven't prioritized that work yet.

**Q: Why do I have to pay service fees when I donate?**

**A:** While we are passionate beyond belief about enabling community wherever you are, raising money for great causes, and [travel by giving](http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/travel-by-giving/) -- Horizon is a business, not a charity. Great technology requires significant investment in order to maintain the current platform, and continue to innovate with new tools to facilitate in person relationships. If you are a member of a community on the [enterprise plan](http://www.horizonapp.co/hospitality-network-setup/), all your transactions will be waived for stays with other members of that specific community.

**Q: I love Horizon's ability to build community and increase donations, and want it to exist for my non profit organization, college, or university. Can we create a branded solution?**

**A:** Yes. [Contact us for details](mailto:support@horizonapp.co)
