**Q: What is Horizon?**

**A:** Horizon helps travelers find places to stay with people they trust.

**Q: How does it work?**

**A:** Login with your Facebook account, then indicate the groups whose members you are interested in connecting in person with. Once past the onboarding screens, you can find members by location who are connected to you through mutual friends and shared groups. When you find someone, you may ask them whether they are available to host during your visit. After your stay (if they accept), you'll have the option to say thank you by making a donation. Note that hosts can enable and disable visibility of their accommodation details based on their level of connection to you and for specific groups.

### Donations ###

**Q: Why do I have to pay service fees when I donate?**

**A:** While we are passionate beyond belief about enabling community wherever you are, raising money for great causes, and [travel by giving](http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/travel-by-giving/) -- we are operating a business, not a charity. Great technology requires significant investment in order to maintain the current platform, and continue to innovate with new tools to facilitate in person relationships. 

If you are a member of a community on the [enterprise plan](http://www.horizonapp.co/hospitality-network-setup/), all your transactions will be waived for stays with other members of that specific community.

**Q: I'm in favor of saying thank you with a donation, but why do I have to donate to Kiva?**

**A:** You don't. If you would like to say thanks to your host by donating to another charity, you are more than welcome to do so though you'll have to donate directly via their website. The long term plan is to give any host the ability to raise money for their favorite charity, directly from the Horizon platform. That said, we need to ensure our system and process are airtight with one charity before we worry about making it work with others.

**Q: Why should I donate through Horizon rather than donating direct?**

**A:** In order to enable more to experience the power of cultural exchange, and increase total donations to great causes in the process. In the future, we plan to track your overall impact, which includes donations made traveling as well as those resulting from hosting. You can see a sample profile with [co-founder Drew Meyers's impact here](http://www.horizonapp.co/drewmeyers).

**Q: Why do I have to pay credit card processing fees?**

**A:** We wish it wasn't so, but processing credit card transactions isn't free. Exact details can be found on our [costs and fees page](http://www.horizonapp.co/costs-fees).

**Q: Why is Horizon supporting Kiva?**

**A:** One of Horizon's co-founders, Drew Meyers, has been a microfinance supporter since [learning about Kiva in 2007](http://www.drewmeyersinsights.com/2007/04/08/kivaorg-loans-that-change-lives-using-web-20-concepts/). He and his friend Jerry co-founded a microfinance blog ([myKRO.org](http://www.mykro.org)) since 2008. Beyond that, finding other [microfinance advocates while traveling](http://www.mykro.org/an-online-community-of-microfinance-advocates-all-over-the-globe/2012/07/) is one of the core pain points Drew experienced while traveling that ended up leading to the creation of Horizon. Additionally, one of our advisors, Sloane Davidson, served as a Kiva Fellow (KF8) in the Philippines.

### Communities ###

**Q: What is a community?**

**A:** A community is a trusted network of people, and source of potential hosts to stay with while traveling. Common communities include facebook friends, friends of friends, or groups which users are affiliated with such as a fraternity or university alumni association. 

**Q: What type of communities is Horizon for?**

**A:** Any community in which members desire to connect in person. Examples include service organizations, religious organizations, professional trade associations, and alumni associations. The ideal community has a large geographic diversity of members.

**Q: Which communities are available?**

**A:** Communities are currently tied to Facebook groups. Beyond the "Horizon Public" group which anyone can join, the only communities that show up inside Horizon as filters are ones we've specifically made visible.

**Q: I want Horizon for my Facebook community. How do I enable that?**

**A:** Share the app with other members, and get 20 people from the Facebook group to sign up and indicate their interest in having Horizon's hospitality exchange offering available to them. We'll turn on additional groups containing at least 20 members.

**Q: What type of community is not ideal?**

**A:** A purely local community in which the vast majority of the members reside in the same geographic area.

**Q: Horizon is NOT...**

**A:** Couchsurfing or AirBnB. 

Couchsurfing is a single hospitality exchange network ([the largest, but not the only](http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/hospitality-networks-history/)), while Horizon enables hospitality exchanges to take place among members of any existing trusted community. [Longer version](http://www.horizonapp.co/blog/couchsurfing-differences/).

AirBnB is a peer to peer accommodation marketplace allowing individuals to monetize their couches, rooms, or homes by renting to anyone with an AirBnB profile and credit card, while Horizon enables you to host only people from your trusted networks in your home, with the ability for those travelers to say thanks by donating to your charity of choice.

### Product Specifics ###

**Q: I don't want to login with a Facebook account - what are my options?**

**A:** Logging in with a Facebook account is currently required to use Horizon. This results in a better experience by enabling us to show you friends, friends of friends, and common group members. We understand their are privacy considerations for some people, and we aim to have a way for people to utilize Horizon without using Facebook down the road.

**Q: How are the counts of cities and countries on my home screen calculated?**

**A:** The counts on your home screen are unique countries & cities where you have either a facebook friend, friend of a friend, or a common group member that has logged into Horizon.

**Q: How do I expand my possible places to stay?**

**A:** Extend an invite to request stay at your home to those you already trust. There is certainly no requirement to reciprocate, but extending an invitation to your own home to others is the best way to get them to open their home to you, and increase the coverage of potential places to stay in unique cities and countries all across the globe.

**Q: Why do only some of my Facebook friends show up?**

**A:** Two potential reasons. First, we only display friends we can associate with a specific locations - some people do not fill out their "lives in" field on Facebook, or have it restricted so other sites cannot access it. Second, Facebook's Graph API 2.0 only returns your friends that are also using the Horizon app.

**Q: Why are accommodation details not available on all profiles?**

**A:** Visibility of accommodation details is controlled per community from your settings. Please realize different people have different living situations. Some have an extra bedroom, or couch - while others live in a tiny studio. Some have a significant other who isn't a huge fan of house guests, or may have kids. Regardless of whether they have the request stay button enabled, you can still contact trusted connections for travel advice, coffee, or a meal.

**Q: How do I edit my profile?**

**A:** The profile photo, name, and bio are all pulled from Facebook, with no edit capability. Your accommodation details is the only piece of information currently editable (via settings). We plan on making more of the profile customizable, but haven't prioritized that work yet.

### Charities ###

**Q: I work for a 501(c)(3) charity, and would like to enable travelers to donate directly from Horizon. How do I do so?**

**Q: I love Horizon's ability to strengthen community and increase donations, and want it to exist for my non profit organization, college, or university. Can we create a branded solution?**
