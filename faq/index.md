**Q: I want Horizon for my community. How do I get started?**

**A:** A successful hospitality network requires pre-existing trust within the community. Submit your request to add a private, trusted hospitality exchange for your community by getting 20 people from the community to sign up.

**Q: What type of communities is Horizon for?**

**A:** Any community in which members desire to connect in person. Examples include service organizations, religious organizations, professional trade associations, and alumni associations. The ideal community has a large geographic diversity of members.

**Q: What type of community is not ideal?**

**A:** A community or group in which the majority of the members reside in the same geographic area. You can still use our offering to easily see faces of everyone in the group, but the request stay functionality won't be relevant if everyone lives in the same area.

**Q: How are you different than Couchsurfing?**

**A:** Couchsurfing is a single hospitality exchange network (the largest, but not the only), while Horizon is a mobile hospitality exchange technology platform. We are focused on building the best technology to enable hospitality exchanges to take place among members of any existing trusted community.

**Q: How are the counts of cities and countries calculated?**

**A:** The counts on your home screen are unique countries & cities where you have either a facebook friend, friend of a friend, or a common group member.

**Q: How do I expand my possible places to stay?**

**A:** Extend an invite to request stay at your home to those you already trust. There is certainly no requirement to reciprocate, but extending an invitation to your home to individual people and communities is the best way to increase the geographic spread of your own network.
