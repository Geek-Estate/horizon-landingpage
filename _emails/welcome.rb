Subject: Welcome to Horizon

Body: 
Welcome to Horizon! When arriving in a new city, you probably want to meet a friendly face. Staying with a friend or trusted connection is the most effective way to experience community while traveling. We built Horizon for those who place more importance on the connection and friendship, than on the details of accommodation.

We believe life's magical moments don't happen staring at your screen, and the power of community to change lives.

If you have questions or suggestions, please send them my way.

Drew Meyers
Co-Founder & CEO

PS: If you're serious about using Horizon to travel or host, we ask that you visit Settings (via the â˜° button) and fill out the "Where Can You Host Guests" and "What Can You Offer Guests" fields.
