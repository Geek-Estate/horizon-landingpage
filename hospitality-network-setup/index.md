Horizon offers a mobile platform enabling hospitality exchange among your community members. Any community that exists inside a Facebook group, can instantly begin using the app to request a place to stay with other trusted members. For some executives and community managers, enabling members to find each other by location may be enough. For others, they may want to make their community paid or gain additional insight into their communities locations and engagement.
