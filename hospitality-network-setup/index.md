Horizon enables community members to find each other by location and exchange hospitality within a trusted environment. 

Public groups can use the mobile platform for free. That said, public groups indicate interest but not trust. For some executives and community managers, enabling members to find each other by location may be enough. For others, they may want to make their community paid to add exclusivity or gain additional insight into their communities locations and engagement.

<ul>
	<li>Allow members to donate directly to your organization</li>
	<li>Charge monthly or yearly membership dues</li>
	<li>Easily pull a list of all members within X miles of a specific city</li>
</ul>
