It's impossible to meet other community members if you don't know where they are.

Horizon allows members to find other trusted community members by location, with the option to host one another during members' travels. In return for accommodation, travelers make donations to your member association or a non profit organization of the host's choosing.

Private groups are a feature for Horizon Patrons. After you become a patron, we'll send you an email to gather details for your personalized group. You can share the private group with members of your community to build your own trusted hospitality network.

Your community can use Horizon free of charge, but there are numerous benefits to upgrading to Enterprise:

<ul>
	<li>Edit group unlock code</li>
  <li>Upload a cover image</li>
  <li>Modify group description</li>
	<li>Allow members to host each other in a private, trusted environment</li>
  <li>Email members from one location</li>
  <li>Find your most passionate community members</li>
  <li>Allow members to donate directly to your organization (planned)</li>
  <li>Easily pull a list of all members within X miles of a specific city (planned)</li>
  <li>Email all members by city (planned)</li>
  <li>Charge monthly or yearly membership dues (planned)</li>
</ul>
