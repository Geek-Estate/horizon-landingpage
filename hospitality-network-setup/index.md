Horizon facilitates community members coming together in person to share conversations, stories, knowledge, jokes, and experiences. Everyone who has built community before knows putting people together in person is the only way to build community. Community does NOT exist without in person interactions, conversations, and experiences.

How do we do it?

By enabling community members to find each other by location and exchange hospitality within a highly trusted environment.
