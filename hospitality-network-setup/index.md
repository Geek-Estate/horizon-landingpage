Horizon allows members to connect and host one another during members' travels. In return for free accommodation, travelers make donations to your member association or a non profit organization of the host's choosing.

Benefits to upgrading to Premium or Enterprise?

<ul>
	<li>Allow members to donate directly to your organization</li>
	<li>Charge monthly or yearly membership dues</li>
	<li>Easily pull a list of all members within X miles of a specific city</li>
	<li>Allow members to host each other in a private, trusted environment</li>
</ul>
