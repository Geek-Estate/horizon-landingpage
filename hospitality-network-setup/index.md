Horizon allows members of your trusted communities (academic, professional, social, religious) to see that you are open to hosting them on their next visit to your beloved city, and you a way to efficiently screen those requests.

Why host you ask?

<ul>
	<li>Have rich social experiences</li>
	<li>Network with like minded individuals</li>
	<li>Help your friends afford to explore the world</li>
	<li>Unlock the magic of your city to out of towners</li>
	<li>Be the "change you want to be in the world", by raising money for your favorite charity</li>
</ul>

Trusted Communities

In addition to those people you know personally and would love to spend more time with, your trusted network consists of members of those communities in which trust exists, even for those you've not met personally. Usually, those communities are based upon a shared friend, passion, belief, or experience and are somewhat exclusive in nature.

We give you the control to indicate which communities you trust.
