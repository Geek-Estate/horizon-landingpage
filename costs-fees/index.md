After completing a stay with Horizon, you’ll be prompted to make a donation in lieu of the typical house gift. We believe that donating to a great cause on your host’s behalf is more impactful to the world than the impact of the bottle of wine or case of beer is to your host. We hope you agree!

Although we would like 100% of these donations to go to non profit organizations, there are some costs which we cannot get around:

- Credit Card Processing Fees - 2.9% + $0.30. This is the standard swipe fee that card processors charge any organization which accepts Debit or Credit Cards.
- Horizon Service Fee of $3.99 - The only way for us to make Horizon work is to charge this service fee. Horizon is a for profit organization and we strive to keep our fee as low as possible. This fee goes to paying our team and keeping the lights on. 

While these fees may same high, they are actually a lot less than the typical 15% - 30% costs that a charity would incur to bring in donations.
