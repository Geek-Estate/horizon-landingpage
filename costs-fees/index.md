After completing a stay with Horizon, you have the option to make a donation in lieu of the typical house gift. We believe that donating to a great cause on your hostâ€™s behalf is more impactful to the world than a bottle of wine or case of beer is to your host. We hope you agree!

Although we would like 100% of these donations to go to non profit organizations, there are some costs which we cannot get around:

- Credit Card Processing Fees (<em>[powered by Stripe](https://stripe.com/us/pricing)</em>) - 2.9% + $0.30. This is the standard transaction fee that card processors charge any organization which accepts Debit or Credit Cards. The [same fees apply to donations made using Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/paypal-fees) to support@horizonapp.co.
- Horizon Service Fee of $3.99 - Horizon is a for profit organization focused on unlocking travel opportunities & raising money for great causes. This fee goes toward paying our team and keeping the lights on. 

While these fees may seem high, they are actually less than the 15% - 30% costs that a charity typically incurs to bring in donations.

For travelers using the "[Stay a Night, Give a Night](http://www.horizonapp.co/stay-night-give-night/)" campaign, Horizon charges a $10 matching fee and a minimum of $14 per night stayed that will be allocated to Mary's Place. For a 2 day stay, it would cost a traveler $38 ($14 * 2 + $10).
