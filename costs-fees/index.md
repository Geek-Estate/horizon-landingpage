After completing a stay with Horizon, you’ll be given the option to make a donation in lieu of the typical house gift. We believe that donating to a great cause on your host’s behalf is more impactful to the world than a bottle of wine or case of beer is to your host. We hope you agree!

Although we would like 100% of these donations to go to non profit organizations, there are some costs which we cannot get around:

- Credit Card Processing Fees - 2.9% + $0.30. This is the standard transaction fee that card processors charge any organization which accepts Debit or Credit Cards.
- Horizon Service Fee of $3.99 - Horizon is a for profit organization focused on unlocking travel opportunities & raising money for great causes. This fee goes toward paying our team and keeping the lights on. 

While these fees may same high, they are actually a lot less than the typical 15% - 30% costs that a charity normally incurs to bring in donations.
