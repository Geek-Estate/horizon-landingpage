                    <div class="post__content">
                        <p>The Penn State community is made up of nearly 100,000 students and more than 631,000 living alumni that can be found in all 50 U.S. states and more than 160 countries in the world. Not only are these connections useful in attaining potential employment/recommendations, the sheer geographical diversity of the Penn State community ensures you have a connection with at least one person anywhere you may be traveling to.
                        </p>

                        <p>The true question is... How do you tap into the vast alumni community in travel scenarios? Introducing, Horizon's Penn State Global Hospitality Network, the first travel app that allows you to find other Penn State students and alumni based on location, with the main focus of exchanging hospitality in travel scenarios. Additionally, Horizon penables local alums and current students to find each other for meet-ups and other face-to-face networking opportunities, building a stronger community.</p>
